## Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to tmplt!

Any form of contribution is accepted, be it bug fixes, implementing a new feature or even just fixing a small typo. The goal is to get the community involved as much as possible

pull requests for bug fixes and features will only be accepted if the approach has been discussed in an issue and a community memeber has been given the go-ahead to work on it

Please keep the following in mind at all times:

* Check existing issues to verify that the [`bug`](https://github.com/humblepenguinn/tmplt/labels/bug) or [`feature request`](https://github.com/humblepenguinn/tmplt/labels/feature%20request) has not already been submitted.
* Open an issue if things aren't working as expected.
* Open an issue to propose a significant change.
* Open a pull request to fix a bug.

* Open a pull request for any issue labelled [`help wanted`](https://github.com/humblepenguinn/tmplt/labels/help%20wanted), [`good first issue`](https://github.com/humblepenguinn/tmplt/labels/good%20first%20issue) or [`community`](https://github.com/humblepenguinn/tmplt/labels/community).

Please avoid:

* Opening pull requests for issues marked `needs-triage`, `needs-investigation`, or `blocked`.
* Opening pull requests for any issue marked `maintainers`. These issues require additional context from
  the maintainers/code owners and any external pull requests will not be accepted.
